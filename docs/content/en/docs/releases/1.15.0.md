## Fixes

## Note

* We have changed installation steps since 1.13.0, please refer latest installation steps. You need to install/replace Custom Resource Definitions(CRDs) before installing Helm chart.
* Environments releases are decoupled from Fission release. Environments would be updated separately from Fission releases.

## Deprecation

* We have deprecated `Spec.Method` in HTTPTrigger since 1.13.0, please use `Spec.Methods` instead.
